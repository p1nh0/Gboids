Gboids
======

Granular synth driven by boids, an agent simulation algorithm.

This patch uses an implementation of Craig Reynolds' "boids" algorithm 
(available in Max Javascript Examples) to drive a granular synthesizer, 
where each agent represents a grain, scrubbing an audio sample 
as it moves in a two-dimensional space.

System Requirements: 
- MaxMSP 5/6
